Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

- Yes,
 // I've heard of it and understand its purpose, but I'm not sure how to apply it through code.
 
 
 
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 
- Yes,
 // However, due to a lack of prerequisite understanding in the programming language, I am unable to programme it.
 
Web API: (Yes/No) 
 
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
 
 -No

Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:
 
 
Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
 1. Codependent
 2. Uniform
 3. Organized
 
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

 - Dividing the functions through different layers allows the architecture to have a systematic and methodical approach to providing outputs.
 - Isolation of modules allows for a more comprehensive way of detecting issues and weaknesses within the infrastructure, by doing so you can isolate the problem without affecting the other layers' individual roles.


Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
 
 - Yes. I had no idea what I was programming due to a lack of information, so I simply searched up different tutorials on how to do each function, which overlapped with the other things I was attempting to do, and in the end it became an amalgamation of different techniques I saw stitched together.


MVC:
 
 
Components: (1-3 keywords each)
 
Model, View, Controller
 
Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
 
 Model: It manages the data, logic, and rules of the application's domain.
 View: Is responsible for presenting the data to the user.
 Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
 

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
 
 Yes, the main issue I have the enough understanding of the structure to be able to connect them.
 

Web API:
 
 
Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
 
- I'm not sure what the key difference is because I'm unfamiliar with how a traditional MVC application looks and performs. However, from what I understand, Web APIs use a blackbox method in which a user asks an output and the API delivers the order.

 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)

- The only problem I experienced was installing all of the project's dependencies. As with the WEB API dependencies, I have no experience debugging these, however I attempted to lower the version to ensure compatibility.
